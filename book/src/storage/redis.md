# Redis

In case you don't have a redis instance running in your system, you might want to look at our [Testdrive](../guides/testdrive.md) guide for a minimal docker example providing a local redis instance. You can also look at the official Redis [Installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

See our [Redis-cli basics](../guides/redis.md) guide to get started playing with Redis from the command line.
