# Usage

Once you have Scrolls and Redis installed in your system (see [Installation](../installation/index.md)) you can start the daemon with the following command:


``` bash
/path/to/scrolls daemon --config /path/to/config.toml
```

Check the [Configuration](../configuration/index.md) section of the manual for further information. If you have no experience using Redis, you can follow the [Redis-cli guide](../guides/redis.md) to learn the basic commands needed to query data using the command line application provided by Redis. For any real application you would need to use a client library in your language of preference. See our [Python](../guides/python.md) and [NodeJS](../guides/nodejs.md) guides.
