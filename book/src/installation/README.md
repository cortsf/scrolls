# Installation

Depending on your needs, Scrolls provides different installation options:

- [Binary Release](binary_release.md): to use one of our pre-compiled binary releases for the supported platforms.
- [From Source](from_source.md): to compile a binary from source code using Rust's toolchain
- [Docker](docker.md): to run the tool from a pre-built docker image


You will also need a data storage backend installed in your system. Currently we support Redis, see our [Testdrive](../guides/testdrive.md) guide for a minimal docker image providing a Redis instance.
